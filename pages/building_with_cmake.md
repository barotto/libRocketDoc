title: Building With CMake
---

The easiest way to build {{page.lib_name}} on Mac and Linux is by using [CMake](http://cmake.org). You'll first need to download CMake or install it via the package manager of your choice on Linux.

CMake is not a build system itself: its purpose is to generates Makefiles, Xcode projects and Visual Studio projects, among other formats.

### Configuration

Before generating your build files you need to configure CMake. Open a terminal window and move to the Build folder of {{page.lib_name}} and execute the following command.

```
buildbox:Build$ ccmake .
```

NOTE: You need the . to denote the current directory is where the CMakeLists.txt is located.

This will open a a text mode application that lest you choose which parts of {{page.lib_name}} you want to build and how you want to build it. Before you can alter any options you'll need to press C so that CMake can scan your system configuration. Once its complete you will see a list of options. The most interesting options are most likely

* *BUILD_LUA_BINDINGS* - Build the required bingings for Lua support. You'll need Lua installed.
* *BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS* - Build the required bindings for python support. You'll need Boost::Python and Python installed.
* *BUILD_SAMPLES* - Should the samples be built
* *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* - Build as .so/.dylib as apposed to a .a file 
* *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* - Choose the build type between: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel, or None (passed in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS flags are used).

Make your selection and press C again so that CMake can recalculate build settings based on your selection. Once CMake is happy you'll be able to press G to generate the build configuration and exit.

### Building

At this point you should be back at the terminal and your Makefile will have been created. You can now build {{page.lib_name}} by executing make.

```
buildbox:Build$ make -j 8
```

NOTE: The -j parameter specifies how many jobs to execute in parallel: you should normally set this to the number of threads supported by your CPU.

Once the build is complete, check out the samples.
