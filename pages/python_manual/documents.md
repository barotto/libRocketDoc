### Interface

Documents derive from elements, so inherit their [interface](elements.html#interface). The document-specific interface is similar to the C++ interface; refer [there](../cpp_manual/documents.md) for the full functional documentation.

####Properties

Python property | Brief description | Equivalent C++ methods
--------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------
context | Retrieves the document's context. | GetContext()
title | Gets / sets the document's title. | GetTitle(), SetTitle()

#### Methods

The following methods are exported from the C++ interface.

Python method | Brief description
------------- | -----------------
CreateElement() | Creates an element by tag name.
CreateTextNode() | Creates a text element.
Close() | Closes the document and destroys all child elements.
Hide() | Hides the document.
PullToFront() | Pulls to the document to the front of others with a similar z-index.
PushToBack() | Pushes to the document behind others with a similar z-index.
Show(flags = FOCUS) | Shows the document, optionally with focus flags.

The flags available for the Show() function are the same as the C++ function. The flags are referenced in Python as:

* NONE
* FOCUS
* MODAL
