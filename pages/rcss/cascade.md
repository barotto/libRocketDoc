This functionality of RCSS is identical to that defined in [CSS2](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html); please refer there for documentation. Important things to be aware of:

* {{page.lib_name}} has no built-in UA style sheet.
* The `!important`{:.tag} tag is not yet supported.
* The `inherit`{:.value} rule is not yet supported.
