### Foreground colour: the 'color' property

`color`{:.prop}

Value: | \<colour\>
Initial: | black
Applies to: | all elements
Inherited: | yes
Percentages: | N/A

This property sets the colour of rendered text and text decorations.

### Background colour

In RCSS, an element's background can be set as a flat colour but not an image. This functionality (and much more!) instead lies with [decorators](decorators.html).

`background-color`{:.prop}

Value: | \<colour\>
Initial: | transparent
Applies to: | all elements
Inherited: | no
Percentages: | N/A

This property sets the color of the element's generated boxes. The background colour is rendered under a box's padded area.

`background`{:.prop}

An alias for `background-color`{:.prop}.
