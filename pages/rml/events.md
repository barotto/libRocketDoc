The event system is based on the extremely flexible DOM event system.

When an event is fired at a target element, it **bubbles** up from the root to the target and then **captures** back down to root. Event listeners can be attached in either capture or bubble phase.

Binding done in RML will always attach to the bubble phase.

For a detailed description of the DOM event system see the W3C Specification.

### RML binding

Event listeners can be bound to an element declared in RML by specifying an attribute with the name of the event to bind to prefixed with `on`{:.attr}. For example, to bind a listener to the `click`{:.evt} event, you would declare something like the following:

```html
<button onclick="load game">Start Game</button>
```

Note that this is the only time you prefix the event name with `on`{:.attr}; all other times an event is referenced, it is done so simply with its name.

### Events in Python

When using the Python plugin, event listeners bound through RML execute Python code. The value of the event attribute will be executed when the event is triggered. Multiple lines of Python code can be put on one line, separated by a semicolon.

```html
<div onclick="print 'hello'; print 'goodbye'">
```

For full details on Python events see the [Python Manual](../python_manual.html).

### Events

Below is a list of events and their associated event attributes.

A number of input events send through key modifiers. In this case the following parameters are set to true if the key modifier is active when the action takes place:

* ctrl_key
* shift_key
* meta_key
* alt_key
* caps_lock_key
* num_lock_key
* scroll_lock_key

#### Keyboard Events

`keydown`{:.evt}
: Sent to the focus element when a key is pressed.
* `key_identifier`: A value from the `{{page.lib_ns}}::Core::Input::KeyIdentifier` enumeration (found in `<{{page.lib_dir}}/Core/Input.h>`{:.incl}).

* `button`: The button that was clicked. 

`dblclick`{:.evt}
: Sent to the element under the mouse cursor when a mouse button is double clicked. Note that the `click`{:.attr} event will always be sent before `dblclick`{:.evt}.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context.
* `button`: The button that was clicked. 

`mouseover`{:.evt}
: Sent to an element as the mouse cursor moves onto it.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context. 

`mouseout`{:.evt}
: Sent to an element as the mouse cursor moves off it.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context. 

`mousemove`{:.evt}
: Sent to the element under the mouse cursor when the mouse is moved.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.

The following events are only sent if the dragged element has a drag property of **drag-drop**. They are sent to elements other than the dragged element, usually as the mouse moves across them.

`dragover`{:.evt}

`dragout`{:.evt}
